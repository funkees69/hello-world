Hi readers! 
Just allow me to introduce myself to you all, I’m Myra Suan-Navarro, happily-married for 9 Years and have 2 beautiful kids. My eldest son he’s now 7 years old and my youngest daughter she’s now 1 year and 8months. 

I’m a full-time working Mom, an Engineer by profession and my past time is baking during weekend or any time if I’m free.

This blog is to inspired Women who are struggling to come up an idea for baking. I’m actually started from the scratch and until now still learning on my own and it helps for me a lot to me the Internet 

No worries gals, you’re NOT alone and I’m also like You! 

This blog is intended to all Women’s to build-up their trust and confidence in baking/cooking.

Happy reading!


Introduction:
Baking and cooking is one of the past-time of every Moms even during weekend/holidays as long as they have free time. But NOT all Moms are loving to do so. 

 I remember when I’m still not that enthusiast in baking, when I’m watched video from YouTube, I was liked “Oh gosh I can’t do that, I’m too lazy for the preparation, the baking tools are expensive, time consuming, needs more effort, talent and patience, etc.”.

Honestly, I’m NOT a pro in baking, BUT my determination to give happiness and satisfaction for my family is the best feeling you can give to them and I’m just like any other Mothers who can do everything for her family even most of the time I/we failed. But then, those failures is/are my inspiration NOT to stop fulfilling what I/We wanted to do.
